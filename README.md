# **Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration**

## **Technique:** Color Inversion

Inverting colors is a straightforward technique that swaps the light and dark values of an image, essentially creating a negative version of the original. While appearing simple, it can yield dramatic and unexpected results.

**Inspiration:**
The transformative power of color inversion, which can entirely reshape an image's mood and atmosphere, captivates me. It reveals overlooked details and evokes a sense of mystery or surrealism.

**Application:**
In my project, I aim to utilize color inversion to offer a fresh interpretation of the selected artwork. This approach may unveil concealed elements or craft a more abstract and symbolically rich representation.
