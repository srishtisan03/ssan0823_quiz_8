## **Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration**

### **Technique:** Color Inversion

Inverting colors is a straightforward technique that swaps the light and dark values of an image, essentially creating a negative version of the original. While appearing simple, it can yield dramatic and unexpected results.

- #### **Inspiration:**
The transformative power of color inversion, which can entirely reshape an image's mood and atmosphere, captivates me. It reveals overlooked details and evokes a sense of mystery or surrealism.

- #### **Application:**
In my project, I'll utilize color inversion to gain a fresh perspective on the chosen artwork. This approach might:

**Unveil Hidden Details:** Inverting colors could reveal previously concealed brushstrokes, textures, or symbolic elements within the artwork, providing insight into the artist's creative process and potential hidden meanings.

**Shift the Narrative:** Inverting the color scheme can transform the mood and symbolism of the artwork. A vibrant scene might take on a melancholic tone, encouraging viewers to reconsider the original message and explore new interpretations.

## **Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration**

### **Technique:** Image Processing Libraries

Numerous image processing libraries are available across different programming languages, providing capabilities for image manipulation, including color inversion.

- #### **Implementation:**
Utilizing an image processing library such as Pillow (Python) or OpenCV (Python/C++), one can load the selected artwork and transform it into its negative counterpart using built-in functions. These libraries offer a straightforward and efficient approach to achieving the intended effect.

- #### **Benefits:**
Image processing libraries furnish pre-existing functions for color inversion, streamlining the coding process and saving time. This enables a focus on the artistic elements of the project and the interaction between the inverted artwork and the original.

- #### **Example Code:**
